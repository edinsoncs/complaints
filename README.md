# Complaints Eth
With the emergence of blockchain 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0, large currencies and companies related to security and cryptocurrency transactions have emerged, even so we continue to suffer cyber attacks, scams by different media and totally false information without veracity.

As more people are interested in cryptocurrencies, scammers are finding more ways to use them. For example, scammers might offer investments and business "opportunities" promising to double your investment or give you financial freedom.

Anyone who promises you a guaranteed yield or dividend is likely a scammer. Just because an investment is well known or endorsed by a celebrity does not mean it is a good or safe thing. That applies to both cryptocurrencies and more traditional investments. Don't invest money that you can't afford to lose.

With the arrival of DEFI projects, the volumes in daily transactions increase, in the same way, digital thefts were forced to carry out different mechanisms to steal a large part of the coins in the most used wallets in the ethereum network.

Eth complaints
It is a non-dapps project, which seeks to obtain complaints made by communities that have suffered attacks or theft of their currencies, with this mechanism we want to obtain the necessary information to prevent future attacks.

As users and investors when we are harmed in this way, there is no means or organization to make the corresponding claim, so ethics complaints would be the community where you can obtain the information and solution to your problem.

We are all looking for a solution, but currently we are not able to get the lost investments returned in full.

Externally in the future for complaints eth will launch a coin for very specific cases and complaints with detailed information and investigation, in this way to achieve its recovery of lost investment by 15% to 50%
